The ultimate goal of physics is finding the Theory of Everything.

This theory would be a single framework that explains all physical aspects of the universe. Right now, we can explain many aspects pretty well. But there’s one major divide.

We have the theory of general relativity, which works very well for big things. We also have the theory of quantum mechanics, which works well for very small things.

But we don’t have a way to combine them.

The Theory of Everything would be a single set of equations that explain all interactions between matter, energy, space, and time.
