# My First Post

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

```js
const doc = getDocBySlug(params.slug);
```

<Quizlet
  question="What does a decreasing absolute error mean?"
  answers={[
    "Our algorithm is getting dumber",
    "Our algorithm is getting smarter",
  ]}
  id="absolute-error"
  indexOfCorrectAnswer={1}
/>
